# DEPRICATED

 I wanted a host's blocker, but im not sure i can make it yet. The more i think about it, the more i see that the idea is grander than I can make. To name a few challenges im thinking i will face:
1. How do I stop people from simply ending the processes that keep this afloat? And if i use some sort of mechanism to keep it up, how do I not get flagged as a virus?
2. How do I tell my autorun file that I am ready to delete lines, and what lines to delete? Im sure there is some way to send data from script to script, or load the script in the script but the more complexity the more vulerabilites. 
3. How do I stop people from debugging code? A couple well placed print()'s of variables would remove all security.

Now, all of this could be prevented via a move to any C language, but i dont think im willing to do that monstrous task at this point. I will leave my code here.

For people who want to use this, addition.py and deletion.py works.
